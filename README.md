# Chatbot Initialization with Optimized Models

## Overview

This repository contains code for initializing a chatbot using a pre-trained language model, specifically targeting optimized models like GPT-J or GPT-Neo for faster performance compared to GPT-2. The chatbot is designed to be easily initialized, with the ability to switch models and optimize performance through GPU acceleration, quantization, and batching.

## Features

- Initialize a chatbot using **GPT-2**, **GPT-Neo**, or **GPT-J** models.
- Optionally load models onto **GPU** for faster inference if available.
- **Optimized models** such as GPT-J offer better performance than GPT-2.
- Supports **quantized models** for reduced size and faster performance.
- Can be extended to handle **batching** for multiple requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot code, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyTorch** (with CUDA support if you want to use GPU)
- **Hugging Face Transformers library**
  
Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch transformers

```
Ensure that CUDA is installed if you are planning to run the code on a GPU. You can check CUDA availability by running:

```bash
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot-initialization.git
   cd chatbot-initialization
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Optimizing Performance

- **GPU**: If you have access to a GPU, make sure to utilize it to speed up model inference.
- **Model Switching**: GPT-J or GPT-Neo provide faster results than GPT-2 without a significant sacrifice in quality.
- **Quantization**: Use quantized models for reduced size and improved performance, especially when running on limited resources.
